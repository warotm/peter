      "message": "hi [Team Member A], it goes without saying that everyone deserves to win. This is evident when I joined [NextGen Corp] and nominated everyone on our team, as shown on the [Company Hub] history. In fact I also encouraged others on the team to nominate for those OUTSIDE of our team (e.g. [External Colleague]) to provide the spotlight for the hard work they've done behind the scene, and indeed they won the award.\n\nThe reality is, when everyone on a team gets nominated, it does not sound genuine, and no one gets the win. It mostly falls to the [Deployment Group] or [Client-Facing Unit]. Does that mean that they deserve the win more than us? Maybe, maybe not, we're not the judge, we're here to support each other in our team.\n\nIf you ask me \"Would you mind giving a few reasons that make you honestly believe this in comparison with the rest of the team members?\", this sentence causes division amongst our team. Is it your intention that we just don't nominate anyone, or everyone gets nominated and we fall back to my previous point about no one gets the win. This sentence also will make [Nominee] (or anyone else we want to consolidate our efforts in nomination) feel bad if he indeed gets the win.\n\nIf you would like to know a guide to meet my expectations, my expectation during this difficult time at [NextGen Corp] (you yourself are going through a difficult time as well), is to support each other, have each other back, and be a force multiplier for others. Comments that sow divisions are destructive, and goes against our spirit in this team. I strongly suggest to think twice before posting similar messages on group chat.",

I won't go that far for just the sake of winning.\n- You said you honestly believed, so the question aimed to understand your perspective of a good team member so that I could try to copy his nice qualities to make myself more valuable to the team and avoid the thought that you might show favouritism in my mind. And because I haven't received any KPI or OKR, how could I know what you or the company expect?\n- Your expectations on the last paragraph are acknowledged but still without any actionable examples.\n- I feel your response is a lot more destructive than my original question.

I first apologise to everyone being involved, but I think it addresses the team culture we're all trying to set here, so here are the key points:\n\n1. The structure of the [Top Achiever Award] is flawed. The 5 categories nominated (based on the company's values) have been changing from time to time. The way of selecting a winner (including the criteria) is not transparent. It mostly falls on the same/similar groups of people\n2. Our team has never won an award. Different format has been tried (me nominating everyone on the team, cause we all contribute to the same goals).\n3. [Nominee] was nominated for his [Query Optimization Initiative] last quarter with a cost savings of [$XXX,XXX in savings]. This record is shown in the [Company Hub]'s company feed, amongst others such as UX Improvements. These are the basis for nomination, which I should've included in previous message (apologies for this one). Unfortunately he did not win the award.\n4. In my opinion, it would really boost the team's morale if one of us gets the award, and since [Nominee] did not win last quarter, for this quarter the cost savings is still accumulating, so this [Query Optimization Initiative] is still valid for this quarter. As a team bonding activity, I thought it would be great if we could join forces and nominate one person.\n5. This group is definitely open to discuss things. Apologies again if he does not sound great. Just some food for thought, have you thought how [Nominee] would think when he read the original message?\n6. I understand now that you would like to know more about [Nominee]'s contributions. And I do apologise if I misunderstood your intentions. I think there're better ways to ask for his contribution or understand the nomination than \"make you honestly believe this in comparison with the rest of the team members\". Please reach out to me directly if you'd like feedback on this one. Again, back to my point of when everyone gets nominated, no one wins. We're all part of the team, we know that it's flawed, and we should feel happy that one of us gets it, right?",
