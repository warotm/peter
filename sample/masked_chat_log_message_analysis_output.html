                <div class="message-content">hi [Team Member A], it goes without saying that everyone deserves to win. This is evident when I joined [NextGen Corp] and nominated everyone on our team, as shown on the [Company Hub] history.

The structure of the [Top Achiever Award] is flawed. The 5 categories nominated (based on the company&#x27;s values) have been changing from time to time. The way of selecting a winner (including the criteria) is not transparent. It mostly falls on the same/similar groups of people<br>2. Our team has never won an award. Different format has been tried (me nominating everyone on the team, cause we all contribute to the same goals).<br>3. [Nominee] was nominated for his [Query Optimization Initiative] last quarter with a cost savings of [$XXX,XXX in savings]. This record is shown in the [Company Hub]&#x27;s company feed, amongst others such as UX Improvements. These are the basis for nomination, which I should&#x27;ve included in previous message (apologies for this one). Unfortunately he did not win the award.<br>4. In my opinion, it would really boost the team&#x27;s morale if one of us gets the award, and since [Nominee] did not win last quarter, for this quarter the cost savings is still accumulating, so this [Query Optimization Initiative] is still valid for this quarter. As a team bonding activity, I thought it would be great if we could join forces and nominate one person.<br>5. This group is definitely open to discuss things. Apologies again if he does not sound great. <span class="has-tactic tactic-social--relational">Just some food for thought, have you thought how [Nominee] would think when he read the original message?<span class="tooltip-text"><br>        <strong>Manipulative Appeal</strong><br>        <div class="tactic-category">Category: Social &amp; Relational</div><br>        <div class="tactic-purpose">Reintroduces guilt by prompting the target to consider the emotional harm they allegedly caused, deflecting from the leader&#x27;s own misconduct.</div><br>        <div class="tactic-driver">Likely Driver: Ego Protection</div><br>        <div><span>Impact Score: </span><span class="impact-negative">-0.5</span></div><br>        <div><span>Confidence: </span><span>100.0%</span></div><br>    </span></span><br>6. I understand now that you would like to know more about [Nominee]&#x27;s contributions. And I do apologise if I misunderstood your intentions. I think there&#x27;re better ways to ask for his contribution or understand the nomination than &quot;make you honestly believe this in comparison with the rest of the team members&quot;. Please reach out to me directly if you&#x27;d like feedback on this one. Again, back to my point of when everyone gets nominated, no one wins. We&#x27;re all part of the team, we know that it&#x27;s flawed, and we should feel happy that one of us gets it, right?</div>

I&#x27;m always available if you need someone to talk to.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I just want to apologise again if I did not understand your intention correctly. You have raised valid points, and <span class="has-tactic tactic-distortion--deception">the underlying root cause of this is because there&#x27;s no face-to-face interactions. Teams messages can be interpreted very differently between people.<span class="tooltip-text"><br>        <strong>Blame-Shifting</strong><br>        <div class="tactic-category">Category: Distortion &amp; Deception</div><br>        <div class="tactic-purpose">Unfairly places the blame for the conflict on an external factor (remote communication) rather than accepting personal responsibility for using manipulative language.</div><br>        <div class="tactic-driver">Likely Driver: Ego Protection</div><br>        <div><span>Impact Score: </span><span class="impact-negative">-0.7</span></div><br>        <div><span>Confidence: </span><span>100.0%</span></div><br>    </span></span> If you were to be in the office right now at your usual spot, next to [Nominee], you could&#x27;ve asked him yourself.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <span class="has-tactic tactic-social--relational">Understandably, with your condition, you cannot commute to the office. This makes it harder to interact, do team work, recognise contributions, be energised and proud of what we do.<span class="tooltip-text"><br>        <strong>Manipulative Appeal</strong><br>        <div class="tactic-category">Category: Social &amp; Relational</div><br>        <div class="tactic-purpose">Appeals to guilt by subtly blaming the target&#x27;s personal &#x27;condition&#x27; and remote status for the conflict, shifting responsibility onto them.</div><br>        <div class="tactic-driver">Likely Driver: Need for Control</div><br>        <div><span>Impact Score: </span><span class="impact-negative">-0.9</span></div><br>        <div><span>Confidence: </span><span>100.0%</span></div><br>    </span></span> Just like when [Team Member C] does the [Frontend Redesign Project], we all gather around (even though we don&#x27;t directly contributed to it), be excited, and show our appreciation for each other.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <span class="has-tactic tactic-social--relational">On top of this, there&#x27;s a number of people being made redundant today, emotions are very high in the office, and it makes all of this much more difficult. There was someone who had teary eyes and I had to comfort them.<span class="tooltip-text"><br>        <strong>Manipulative Appeal</strong><br>        <div class="tactic-category">Category: Social &amp; Relational</div><br>        <div class="tactic-purpose">Appeals to pity by highlighting personal exhaustion and external crises to excuse their poor behavior and pressure the target to drop their grievances.</div><br>        <div class="tactic-driver">Likely Driver: Fear of Incompetence / Failure</div><br>        <div><span>Impact Score: </span><span class="impact-negative">-0.7</span></div><br>        <div><span>Confidence: </span><span>100.0%</span></div><br>    </span></span><br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am exhausted, physically and mentally. All I could hope for us, in our team, is to support each other, because we&#x27;re all human beings, and after work, we&#x27;re still good friends.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you have any feedback or criticism about me, please let me know. I always look for room for improvements, cause I want to be better than just a &quot;manager&quot;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Best regards and hope you had a great and relaxing weekend.<br>&gt; [Team Lead&#x27;s Initials]<br><br>I&#x27;m still calmly digesting it as it is a long message.<br>Since I don&#x27;t want to bother anyone more this Friday evening, I will try to solve this properly on Monday.<br><br>PS. <span class="has-tactic tactic-constructive">[Team Lead], I&#x27;m not comfortable discussing things with you without third-party support at this moment.<span class="tooltip-text"><br>        <strong>Assertive Boundary Setting</strong><br>        <div class="tactic-category">Category: Constructive &amp; De-escalating</div><br>        <div class="tactic-purpose">Clearly and respectfully states a limit for future communication, refusing private discussions and demanding a neutral third party to ensure fairness and safety.</div><br>        <div class="tactic-driver">Likely Driver: Desire for Collaboration</div><br>        <div><span>Impact Score: </span><span class="impact-positive">+0.8</span></div><br>        <div><span>Confidence: </span><span>100.0%</span></div><br>    </span></span></div>
