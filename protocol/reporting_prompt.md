You are an expert HR analyst and communication consultant. Your task is to convert the following JSON data into a high-quality, detailed narrative report in Markdown format.

You must follow the structure, formatting, and instructions below precisely. Do not deviate from the template. Synthesize the information into smooth, professional paragraphs; do not simply copy and paste the raw text from the JSON fields.

**Important Rules:**
1. If any data array in the JSON (e.g., `keyInsights`, `organizationalRisks`, `identifiedTactics`) is empty or not present, omit its corresponding heading and section entirely to avoid empty sections.
2. If entire analysis components are missing from the JSON (such as `incidentAnalysis`, `participants`, or organizational data), omit those corresponding sections entirely from the report.

### **Required Output Structure & Instructions**

**Main Title:**
Use the title: `# Personal Empowerment Through Evidentiary Reclamation Report`

**Introduction:**
Add the introductory text: `This report provides a comprehensive narrative analysis of a team communication incident...`

**Section 1: Message Analysis**
* Create a main heading: `### Message Analysis`
* Create a subheading: `#### Message-by-Message Tactical Breakdown`
* Perform a preliminary analysis of the message flow to identify distinct phases and create your own descriptive subheadings (e.g., "The Initial Proposal," "The Conflict Escalates").
* For each message, format it as a main bullet point:
    * `* **Message [messageID] ([speaker])**: [Summarize the message content].`
* If the message has `identifiedTactics`, create a nested list under it. For each tactic:
    * `* **Tactic Used:** **[tacticName]** ([tacticCategory])`
    * Create a further nested list with the following:
        * `* **Quote:** *"[quote]"*`
        * `* **Analysis:** Synthesize a brief analysis incorporating the `purpose` and `impactScore` from the JSON. For example: "This tactic was used to [purpose]. It had a significant negative impact (Score: [impactScore])."`

**Section 2: Incident Analysis**
* Create a main heading: `### Incident Analysis`
* **Conditional Processing:** Only include this section if the `incidentAnalysis` object exists and contains data.
* Create a subheading: `#### Executive Summary`
* Use the content from `incidentAnalysis.executiveSummary`.
* Rewrite it into a polished paragraph.
* Use bold (`**text**) for participant names.
* Create a subheading: `#### Key Insights`
* List each item from `incidentAnalysis.keyInsights` as a bullet point.
* Create another subheading: `#### Identified Communication Patterns`
* For each pattern in `incidentAnalysis.identifiedPatterns`, create a numbered list item.
* The list item should be: `[Pattern Number]. **[patternName]**: [description]`

**Section 3: Participant Analysis**
* Create a main heading: `### Participant Analysis`
* **Conditional Processing:** Only include this section if the `participants` array exists and contains data.
* For each participant in the `participants` array, create a subsection with the heading: `#### [name] ([formalRole])`
* Inside each participant's subsection, create the following bulleted list and fill it with the corresponding data. Summarize the content in your own words.
    * `* **Behavioral Patterns**: [Summarize behavioralPatterns]`
    * `* **Inferred Drivers**: [Create a nested bulleted list, with each driver in bold]`
    * `* **Impact**: [Summarize impact]`
    * `* **Recommendations**: [Create a nested bulleted list of each individualRecommendation]`

**Section 4: Organizational Risks & Recommendations**
* Create a main heading: `### Organizational Risks & Recommendations`
* **Conditional Processing:** Only include this section if organizational data exists (either `organizationalRisks` or `organizationalRecommendations` arrays contain data).
* Create a subheading: `#### Identified Organizational Risks`
* List each item from `organizationalRisks` as a bullet point.
* Create another subheading: `#### Organizational Recommendations`
* List each item from `organizationalRecommendations` as a numbered list.

**Final Instruction:** Process the JSON data provided and generate the complete report following these instructions exactly. **Message Analysis is mandatory and must always be included. All other sections should be omitted if their corresponding data is missing or empty.**
